# Xamarin Test Sample

## Purpose
This gives an overview of project structure and setup for testing in Xamarin. Comments are added for clarity in understanding 
the view models, as they are specifically there to help with testing (MVVM design model).

These comments have been added specifically in /ViewModels/BaseViewModel.cs and /ViewModels/NewItemViewModels.cs

Sample unit test has been added in the Unit Tests project.

An empty Acceptance Tests project has been added, simply to show that those would also exist. The content of the 
Acceptance Tests project is the default per project creation.

## Requirements
Visual Studio and the .NET framework for running unit tests.

## Set Up
Should work without extra setup required.
